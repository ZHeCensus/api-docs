### Discovering Census data

You're probably thinking: "How am I supposed to know what codes to use inside those parameters?" - or - "Where did that `"cbp"` & `"ESTAB"` stuff come from?" The data sets covered by the CitySDK are vast. As such, this is the steepest part of the learning curve. But, don't worry, there are a number of different resources available to assist you in your quest:

1. The Census [Developers' Microsite](https://www.census.gov/developers/)
2. The [Census Discovery Tool](https://api.census.gov/data.html).
3. Census [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/uscensusbureau/shared_invite/enQtMjQ3NzUyNTM3NDU3LTZmNGI1MmQzY2Y2ZTU1ODJhNDQwMmY2YmZiNmFkNzg4YmJkYmQzZjQyNDhkNDYxN2JhYjkxZDEwMGI2OGU5NzQ) and [Gitter](https://gitter.im/uscensusbureau/citysdk) developer communities.
