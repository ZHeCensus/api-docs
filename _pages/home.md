This site provides documentation, examples, guides primarily focused on using the Census API in frontend and backend Javascript applications by unitizing the CitySDK library. The format of this site designed interactive and accessible. 

## What does the Census Bureau do?

The Census Bureau's suverys provide a wide range of information on the population and economy of the nation. The data is used by local, state, and federal goverements to determine the distribution of represention, and make planning decisions about community services and funding. 

The data is available to the publicly via [Data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/), and for developers via an [API](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/about.html). 

## CitySDK

CitySDK streamlines the development of applications that use the Census Bureau Data. It combines the Data API with TIGER, to provide GeoJSON (geographic shapes), and geocoder, to provide translations from latitude/longitude to the required geography study area. This abstracts the multiple APIs into one query allowing for developers, data scientisit, and civic innovators to drastically reduce the time to explore data, get insightsm abd develop applications.

[CitySDK v2.0(beta)](https://uscensusbureau.github.io/citysdk/) is currently maintained by Logan Powell
